This project implements a Python script to process accelerometer data and calculate step counts from recorded motion.
Mobile phone was used to capture accelerometer data for activities like sitting, standing, walking, and running.

The Python script computes step count from the accelerometer data in the provided file. Includes an implementation of a sliding window.

Avoids shortcuts like np.convolve and third-party peak-finding libraries (extra points for manual implementations).
